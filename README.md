Predicting Teslaâ€™s stock price over some months using an LSTM model. Tweets about Tesla are used to improve prediction accuracy.

***Disclaimer:** The LSTM model cannot be used to predict Tesla's stock price in real life. The stock market is highly unpredictable, therefore, prediction models do not work. In this project, the validation phase is used for analysis. The purpose of this project is to implement Multivariate Time-Series Prediction using LSTM.*
