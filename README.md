Predicting Teslaâ€™s stock price over some months using an LSTM model. Tweets about Tesla are used to improve prediction accuracy.

***Disclaimer:** The LSTM model cannot be used to predict Tesla's stock price in real life. The stock market is highly unpredictable, therefore, prediction models do not work. In this project, the validation phase is used for analysis. The purpose of this project is to implement **Multivariate Time-Series Prediction using LSTM.***

## Problem Description
In this project, we investigate the significance of tweets about a company, **Tesla, Inc.** in this case, in predicting its stock price. At first, we predict the stock price over some months using an **LSTM Multivariate Time-Series Prediction** model without including the sentiment scores of tweets. After that, we get the tweets, clean them up and compute their daily average sentiment scores using **TextBlob.** Lastly, we include the sentiment scores as a feature in our LSTM model and predict the stock price.

### Data
The csv files and model states can be accessed from the *data* folder.

## Solution Approach

At first, we use the following as **features** and Adj Close price as the **response:**

- High price
- Low price
- Open price
- Close price
- Volume

The features are normalized, because an LSTM network is sensitive to the scale of data, then converted to tensors.

LSTM model **parameters:**

- `input_size=5`
- `num_classes=1`
- `optimizer=Adam`
- `loss_function=MSELoss()`

LSTM model **hyperparameters** after tuning with **Ray Tune** using Grid Search Algorithm:

*Resources leveraged from **Google Colab:** 2 CPUs, 1 GPU.*

- `hidden_size=3`
- `num_layers=1`
- `learning_rate=0.001`
- `num_epochs=8000`

Results (**Mean Squared Error**):
- Training and Validation: **108.98853599149807**
- Training: **0.37573209398539453**
- Validation: **429.7357225013402**
