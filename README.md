Predicting Teslaâ€™s stock price over some months using an LSTM model. Tweets about Tesla are used to improve the prediction accuracy.

***Disclaimer:** The LSTM model cannot be used to predict Tesla's stock price in real life. The stock market is highly unpredictable, therefore, prediction models do not work. In this project, the validation phase is used for analysis. The purpose of this project is to implement **Multivariate Time-Series Prediction using LSTM.***

## Problem Description
In this project, we investigate the significance of tweets about a company, **Tesla, Inc.** in this case, in predicting its stock price. First, we predict the stock price over some months using an **LSTM Multivariate Time-Series Prediction** model without including the sentiment scores of tweets. Then, we clean up the tweets and compute their daily average sentiment scores using **TextBlob.** Lastly, we include the sentiment scores as a feature in our LSTM model and predict the stock price.

### Data
The csv files and model states can be accessed from the *data* folder.

## Solution Approach

At first, we use the following as **features** and Adj Close price as the **response:**

- High price
- Low price
- Open price
- Close price
- Volume

The features are **normalized,** because an LSTM network is sensitive to the scale of data, then **converted to tensors.**

LSTM model **parameters:**

- `input_size=5`
- `batch_first=True`
- `num_classes=1`
- `optimizer=Adam`
- `loss_function=MSELoss()`

LSTM model **hyperparameters** after tuning with **Ray Tune** using Grid Search Algorithm:

- `hidden_size=3`
- `num_layers=1`
- `learning_rate=0.001`
- `num_epochs=8000`

***GPU** is leveraged.*

Results (**Mean Squared Error**):

- Training and Validation: **108.98853599149807**
- Training: **0.37573209398539453**
- Validation: **429.7357225013402**

The tweets are **cleaned** in the following ways:

- Adding whitespaces to the ends
- Removing http links
- Removing special characters and numbers
- Lowercasing
- Removing stop words

After that, they are **lemmatized** and a **frequency analysis** is performed on the words.

**Sentiment scores** are calculated for each tweet using **TextBlob,** within the range [-1.0, 1.0], where -1.0 is a negative polarity and 1.0 is positive. A score of 0.0 refers to a neutral evaluation of the tweet. Afterwards, a **frequency analysis** is performed on the sentiment scores. Lastly, the **daily average sentiment scores** are computed and those that are 0.0 removed.

Lastly, we add Sentiment Scores of tweets as a feature in our LSTM model.

LSTM model **parameters:**

- `input_size=6`
- `num_classes=1`
- `optimizer=Adam`
- `loss_function=MSELoss()`

LSTM model **hyperparameters** after tuning with **Ray Tune** using Grid Search Algorithm:

- `hidden_size=5`
- `num_layers=1`
- `learning_rate=0.002`
- `num_epochs=8000`

***GPU** is leveraged.*

Results (**Mean Squared Error**):

- Training and Validation: **35.028627722561374**
- Training: **0.11838243676105603**
- Validation: **138.12294583219045**

### Conclusion
As we can see from the Mean Squared Error results of Prediction With and Without Sentiment Scores, adding the Sentiment Scores of tweets as a feature in the LSTM model improves its prediction accuracy.
